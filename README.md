EVM Hacking accusation can be debarred by using blockchains.
We can build a system using blockchains in which all political parties are given some random name and vote count being dislpayed at all times to one person from each party without knowing the random name alloted to them.
At the end of the election day or may be at a later stage they'll be presented with the name which was alloted to them.
This can be done with the help of systems present or by istalling them at various Polling booths.
